# sort
The program implements the following sorting algorithms and measures their execution times:

Selection sort: This algorithm repeatedly selects the minimum (or maximum) element from the remaining unsorted portion and places it in its correct position. The program measures the time taken by selection sort to sort the given list.

Bubble sort: This algorithm repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The program measures the time taken by bubble sort to sort the given list.

Insertion sort: This algorithm builds the final sorted array one element at a time by inserting each element into its correct position within the sorted portion of the list. The program measures the time taken by insertion sort to sort the given list.

Quicksort: This algorithm employs a divide-and-conquer strategy by selecting a pivot element and partitioning the list into two sublists. The program measures the time taken by quicksort to sort the given list.

Merge sort: This algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer approach by dividing the list into smaller sublists, sorting them individually, and then merging them back together. The program measures the time taken by merge sort to sort the given list.

Heapsort: This algorithm constructs a binary heap from the input list and repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap until the list is sorted. The program measures the time taken by heapsort to sort the given list.

By measuring the execution times of these sorting algorithms, the program provides insights into their efficiency and performance characteristics, helping users determine the most suitable algorithm for their specific sorting needs.
